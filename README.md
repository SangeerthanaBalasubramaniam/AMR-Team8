Design Criteria:
In this project, we get the query from the user's input, process it according to the needs with respect to the working data file and we produce the desired output.

Methods:
get_ip(): gets the input from the text box provided in the frontend(to from query)
get_data() : gets the selected rows data and provide it as a "OHLC bar-chart" for the user

Instruction to run and set up:
1)Import/install the necessary packages needed:
	pandas
	streamlt
	os
	json
	plotly.graph_objects

2)Make sure all the files are in the same directory
3)Save the file 
4)From the terminal, give the command in the following format(for windows):
 >> streamlit run <filepath>/app_index.py
Note:
Need to replace <filepath> with the actual file path of app_index.py file in your system

5)a)(Only for IDE based implementation) On successful build, It will display as:
 You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: <url will be displayed>
  Network URL: <url will be displayed>

Click on any of the link to view the application

5)b)(From system's terminal):It will be directly directing you to the app's page

Crafted with love!
